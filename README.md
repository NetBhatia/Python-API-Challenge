# Python-API-Challenge - Module 6
Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. 
Instructions
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, we create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and create a representative model of weather across cities.

Part 2 : VacationPy
In this deliverable we use our weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, we will use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
Main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ our Python skills to create map visualizations.
